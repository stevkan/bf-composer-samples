For example, if the customer says \"I want to buy a red car,\" you don't need to ask them which color car, because the bot recognizes the Color entity in what they typed. The bot will then skip the question where you asked for color. \n\nYou can also use entities to recognize a specific list of options. In this lesson, we identify State as the entity, and the bot will recognize any US state the user types."},"Lesson 4 - A topic with a condition, variables and custom entity.-new_topic_1ccbd3506d584b0fa00e53be9fe0161d_85df75ce08a44a9b82cc8f3fdb25f669":{"type":"event","name":"dispatchTo_new_topic_1ccbd3506d584b0fa00e53be9fe0161d_85df75ce08a44a9b82cc8f3fdb25f669","description":"Lesson 4 - This lesson continues to show you how you can create a topic with a conditional branch, variable, and custom entity.  \n\nIn particular it will allow an entity to bypass a follow up question.
